* Database Readings

The following is a collection of resources to construct databases.
My initial line of research is in constructing a database that allows for abstraction and combinators in constructing the search clauses.

* Datalog

Following is a collection of resources for understanding the construction of Datalog:

** [[https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/721/jim/DatalogPaper.pdf][What You Always Wanted to Know About Datalog (And Never Dared to Ask)]]
Looks like a neat paper on the internals of Datalog.

Speaker notes on constructing a Datalog in Clojure.

A blogpost on constructing a simple Datalog engine in Haskell to understand its semantics.

A blogpost on building a database with Datalog in Clojure in less than 500 lines of code.

** To Investigate

*** History of Datalog

I kind of know that Datalog have Horn Clauses as their primitives but need to investigate exactly how they figure in terms of representation and generality in logic.
What kind of logic are they capable of expressing with them?
What kind of lattice/structure is their underlying model? What does this preclude / exclude?

*** Souffle

* Linked Data

Linked data, triple store, and the RDF movement in the web space is well worth understanding to know how it evolved and failed to garner the traction to become mainstream. I feel thereâ€™s some good work done in this field.
