* Database Readings

The following is a collection of resources to construct databases.
My initial line of research is in constructing a database that allows for abstraction and combinators in constructing the search clauses.

* Relational Algebra

** Tools

*** [[https://github.com/alf-tool/alf][Alf]]
Alf is a modern query language, rooted in relational algebra, and implemented as a Ruby Domain Specific Language.

An implementation of Datalog with a focus on managing UIs & UI state.

* Datalog

Following is a collection of resources for understanding the construction of Datalog:

Looks like a neat paper on the internals of Datalog.

** To Investigate

*** History of Datalog

I kind of know that Datalog have Horn Clauses as their primitives but need to investigate exactly how they figure in terms of representation and generality in logic.
What kind of logic are they capable of expressing with them?
What kind of lattice/structure is their underlying model? What does this preclude / exclude?
How does Blake Canonical Form link with Horn Clauses?
Is minimization of boolean algebra somehow related to unification?

Ginsburg later in his life got interested in Datalog and Object Histories. It could be worthwhile to investigate what he was up to.

* Linked Data

Linked data, triple store, and the RDF movement in the web space is well worth understanding to know how it evolved and failed to garner the traction to become mainstream. I feel there’s some good work done in this field.
